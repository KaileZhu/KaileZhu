%\section{Proposed Solution}\label{sec:solution}

In the following sections, we present the main solution of this work.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:logic_graph}, the optimal plan synthesis which is performed offline is first
described in Sec.~\ref{subsec:initial-synthesis},
and then the online adaptation strategy to handle dynamic changes in Sec.~\ref{subsec:online-adaptation}.
The overall solution is summarized in Sec.~\ref{subsec:summary} with analyses
for completeness, optimality and complexity.
