\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, a novel anytime planning algorithm has been proposed for
the minimum-time task planning of multi-agent systems
under complex and collaborative temporal tasks.
Furthermore, an online adaptation algorithm has been proposed to tackle
fluctuations in the task duration and agent failures during online execution.
Its efficiency, optimality and adaptability have been validated extensively via
simulations and experiments.
\textcolor{blue}{Future work includes the distributed methods for computing
the products between local and global R-posets.
This can potentially alleviate the complexity bottleneck
when translating a long LTL formula into its associated NBA.}
