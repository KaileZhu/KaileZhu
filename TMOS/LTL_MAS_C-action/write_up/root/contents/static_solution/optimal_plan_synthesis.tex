\section{Optimal Plan Synthesis}\label{subsec:initial-synthesis}
%==============================
The optimal plan synthesis aims to solve Problem~\ref{prob:formulation} offline.
As mentioned previously in Sec.~\ref{subsec:multi-ltl},
most related work requires the synchronized product of all agents' model,
thus subject to exponential complexity.
Instead, we propose an anytime algorithm that combines seamlessly the partial-ordering analyses
of the underlying task automaton for task decomposition,
and the branch and bound (BnB) search method for task assignment.
In particular, it consists of three main components:
(i) the pre-processing of the NBA associated with the global task;
(ii) the partial-ordering analyses of the processed task automaton;
(iii) the BnB search algorithm that searches in the plan space
given the partial ordering constraints.
