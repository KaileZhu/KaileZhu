\section{Simulations and Experiment}\label{sec:experiments}

This section contains the numerical validation over large-scale multi-agent systems, both in simulation and on actual hardware.
The proposed approach is implemented in Python3 on top of Robot Operating System (ROS) to enable communication across planning, control and perception modules.
All benchmarks are run on a workstation with 12-core Intel Conroe CPU.
More detailed descriptions and experiment videos can be found in the supplementary file.
