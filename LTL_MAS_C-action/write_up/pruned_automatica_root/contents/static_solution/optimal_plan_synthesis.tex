\section{Optimal Plan Synthesis}\label{subsec:initial-synthesis}
%==============================
The optimal plan synthesis aims to solve Problem~\ref{prob:formulation} offline.
In particular, it consists of three main components:
(i) the pre-processing of the NBA associated with the global task;
(ii) the partial-ordering analyses of the processed task automaton;
(iii) the BnB search algorithm that searches in the plan space
given the partial ordering constraints.
