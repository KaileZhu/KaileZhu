\subsection{Hardware Experiment}\label{subsec:hardware-experiment}
For further validation with hardware,
a similar setup is built as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws}.
In total~$4$ UAVs and $2$ UGVs are deployed in the workspace of of $4\times5\, m^2$.
Each robot communicates wirelessly to the control PC via ROS,
of which the state is monitored by the OptiTrack system.
Different tasks and scenarios are designed to show
how the proposed methods perform on actual hardware.

%==============================

The workspace mimics the PV farm described in the numerical simulation.
As showed in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws},
there are~$6$ PV panels ($\texttt{p}_1$-$\texttt{p}_6$, marked in blue),
$4$ transformer substations
($\texttt{t}_1$-$\texttt{t}_4$, marked in red)
and~$1$ base station ($b_1$ marked in yellow).
Moreover,~$4$ UAVs and~$2$ UGVs are deployed to maintain the PV farm,
where the $UAVs$ are Crazyflie mini-drones, denoted by~$V_f$, and
the $UGVs$ are cars with four mecanum wheels (denoted by~$V_s$, $V_l$).
Existing mature navigation controllers are used and omitted here for brevity.
The routine maintenance task can be specified with the following LTL formulas:
\begin{equation}\footnotesize
\begin{aligned}
	\varphi_4=& \Diamond(\texttt{repair}_{\texttt{p}_2} \land  \lnot\texttt{scan}_{\texttt{p}_2} \land \Diamond
	\texttt{scan}_{\texttt{p}_2}
	\land \Diamond (\texttt{sweep}_{\texttt{p}_2} \\
	& \land \lnot \texttt{repair}_{\texttt{p}_2}) )\land \Diamond \texttt{fix}_{\texttt{t}_1} \land \Diamond \texttt{scan}_{\texttt{p}_3}
	\land \Diamond \texttt{wash}_{\texttt{p}_5},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which can be understood in a similar way to~$\varphi_1$ in~\eqref{eq:task1}.

%==============================
\subsubsection{Results}\label{subsubsec:hw-results}
First, we describe the nominal scenario.
Following the procedure described in Alg.~\ref{alg:complete},
the LTL formula is converted to its NBA~$\mathcal{B}$ with $62$ nodes and $521$ edges.
And the pruned NBA~$\mathcal{B}^-$ has $62$ nodes and $377$ edges.
Only one R-poset is found with Alg.~\ref{alg:compute-poset},
which contains~$6$ subtasks whose language~$L(P)$ equals to the full language~$L(\mathcal{B}^-)$.
Furthermore, Alg.~\ref{alg:BnB} finds the
optimal task assignment within~$3.7s$,
which has the estimated makespan of~$124s$, after exploring~$59$ nodes.
During execution, it is worth noting that due to collision avoidance and communication delays,
the fluctuations in the time of navigation and task execution are \emph{significant}.
Consequently, the proposed online synchronization protocol in Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:uncertain}
plays an important role to ensure that the partial constraints
are respected during execution,
instead of simply following the optimal schedule.
The execution of the complete task lasts~$170s$ and
the resulting trajectories are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws}.
Moreover, to test the online adaptation procedure
as described in Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:failure},
one UAV~$V_{f_4}$ is stopped manually to mimic a motor failure during execution at~$75s$.
During adaptation, a new node is located the BnB search tree
given the set of unfinished tasks
and the search is continued until a new plan is found within~$0.8s$.
As a result, UAV~$V_{f_1}$ takes over the subtask~$\texttt{scan}_{\texttt{P}_2}$
to continue the overall mission.
The resulting trajectory is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws},
where the trajectory of~$V_{f_4}$ before failure is shown in red,
and the trajectory in blue is that of another UAV taking over the subtasks.
In the end, the complete task is accomplished in $178s$.
